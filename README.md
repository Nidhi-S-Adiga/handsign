# HAND SIGN DETECTION

Welcome to the Hand Sign Detection project!

Hand sign detection is the process of recognizing and classifying hand gestures made by an individual. Hand sign detection has many applications, including:







- Sign language detection
- Human-computer interaction
- Robotics
- Gaming
 Our project deals with sign language detection.
## Features

- Sign Language detection is a process to detect and classify hand gestures in real-time using a webcam.
- Sign Language detection is a process to detect and classify hand gestures in a realtime using webcam.
- American Sign Language(ASL) is used in this project.
- Python programming language is highly important in developing computer vision models for hand sign language detection.

This project aims to detect hand signs using computer vision techniques in Python. The code is based on the OpenCV library and uses a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification.

## How to Run:
To run the project, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Install the required libraries using the requirements.txt file. 
- You can do this by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your command prompt or terminal.
- Install library functions mediapipe,Tensorflow,opencv.
- Data collection should contain a large number of examples of each gesture, captured from different angles and under different lighting conditions.
- By using control signal as mentioned in program code we should press s and save our hand pictures and multiple pictures must be saved.
- Training a model here by using Teachable meachine we will convert our jpg images into kernal model.
- Open the data collection.py file and edit the path to the image or video you want to detect hand signs in.
- Run the test.py file using Python.
- The output of the project will be the input image or video with the detected hand sign labeled.

This project can be improved by tranining model for all alphabets.
We hope you find this project useful and informative. Please feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
